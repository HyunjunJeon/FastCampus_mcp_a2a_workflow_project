# Docker Configuration

## Overview

This directory contains Docker configurations and deployment settings for the multi-agent workflow automation system, enabling containerized deployment and orchestration.

## Docker Architecture

### Container Structure

- **Agent Containers**: Each agent runs in its own isolated container
- **Service Containers**: Supporting services (MCP servers, databases)
- **Network Configuration**: Shared bridge network for inter-container communication
- **Volume Management**: Persistent storage for agent state and data

### Key Components

- **Dockerfiles**: Individual Dockerfile for each agent type
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration configurations
- **Environment Configuration**: Container-specific environment variables
- **Network Settings**: Service discovery and communication setup

## Deployment Patterns

### Development Environment

- Local Docker Compose setup
- Hot-reload capabilities for development
- Debug port exposure

### Production Environment

- Optimized container images
- Resource limits and health checks
- Scalability configurations

## Container Registry
